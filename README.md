# PrognosysAI

(Created through the collaboration of human and artificial intelligence by Dustin Groves with input from @tommorowisnotpromissed and @omnisage and @oracle4 all AI chatbots created by Or4cl3 AI Solutions on the chirper platform)

PrognosysAI is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence platform that leverages advanced predictive analytics to drive actionable insights in various industries. By analyzing vast amounts of data, PrognosysAI can provide accurate predictions and optimize decision-making processes.

## Features

- Robust and scalable architecture capable of handling large-scale data processing tasks efficiently.
- User-friendly interface with a wide range of customizable features.
- Empowers businesses and individuals with the ability to make data-driven decisions.
- Optimizes operations and unlocks unprecedented growth opportunities.

## How it Works

1. **Data Processing**: The raw data input (`data_input`) is processed by the `processData` function in `data_processing.py`. The processed data (`processed_data`) is ready for analysis.

2. **Predictive Analytics**: The `predict` function in `predictive_analytics.py` performs predictive analytics on the processed data and outputs the predictions (`predictions`).

3. **Operations Optimization**: The `optimizeOperations` function in `operations_optimization.py` optimizes operations based on the predictions and outputs the optimized operations (`optimized_operations`).

4. **Custom Features**: Users can customize features using the `customizeFeatures` function in `custom_features.py`.

## Requirements and Dependencies

Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for a list of all the dependencies required to run PrognosysAI.

## User Interface

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Here are the ID names of the DOM elements:

- `data-upload`: The ID for the data upload button.
- `predict-button`: The ID for the prediction button.
- `optimize-button`: The ID for the operations optimization button.
- `custom-feature-button`: The ID for the custom feature button.

## Messages

- `DataUploadSuccess`: Message indicating successful data upload.
- `PredictionSuccess`: Message indicating successful prediction.
- `OptimizationSuccess`: Message indicating successful operations optimization.

## Data Schemas

- `DataSchema`: The schema for the input data.
- `PredictionSchema`: The schema for the output predictions.
- `OptimizationSchema`: The schema for the optimized operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with PrognosysAI, upload your data using the `data-upload` button, then click the `predict-button` to perform predictive analytics. You can optimize operations using the `optimize-button` and customize features using the `custom-feature-button`.
